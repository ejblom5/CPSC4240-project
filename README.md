# CPSC4240-project
Ideas for what we want the program to do...
- List devices on the network
  - ifconfig # get the ip address/mask
  - sudo nmap {ip}/{mask} | grep MAC # get the list of host names on the network
- Network analysis
  - speed,bandwidth,total data usage, etc.
- Most visited ip/web sites
- information abou the host device
- information about the devices on the network

Installed linux tools (through apt)
- nmap
- net-tools
